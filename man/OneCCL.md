&quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot;

 - 1 Enables the caching of get IPC handles (default).



By-default: &quot;1&quot; 
        

## CCL_ZE_ENABLE_OVERSUBSCRIPTION_FALLBACK


Set to enable oversubscription in topo fallback stage for all collectives. 
        


This enviroment variable enables or disables the oversubscription fallback from topo algorithm to copy in/out
&quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot; : &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;
By-default: &quot;1&quot; 
        

## CCL_ZE_ENABLE_OVERSUBSCRIPTION_THROW


Set to enable oversubscription throw for all collectives. 
        


This enviroment variable enables or disables the oversubscription throw check

Example value: &quot;/custom/path/to/devices/&quot;
By-default: &quot;/dev/dri/by-path/&quot;

## CCL_REDUCE_SCATTER_MONOLITHIC_PIPELINE_KERNEL


Set to specify monolithic pipeline approach for reduce_scatter phase in allreduceand reduce collectives. 
        


This enviroment variable has the advantage of forming a seamless pipeline that conceals the data transfer time across MDFI. This way, a process reads the data from its peer tile on the same GPU, performs the reduction, and writes to a temporary buffer located on a different GPU. This modification will cover the time for transferring the data through XeLinks during the reduce-scatter phase in allreduce and reduce collectives.
&quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot; : &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;
By-default: &quot;1&quot; 
        

## CCL_ZE_IPC_EXCHANGE


Set to specify the mechanism to use for Level Zero IPC exchange. 
        


<br />
 &quot;drmfd&quot; - Uses a the DRM mechanism for Level Zero IPC exchange. This is an experimental mechanism that is used with OS kernels previous to SP4. To use the DRM mechanism, the libdrm and drm headers must be available on a system. <br />
 &quot;pidfd&quot; - Uses pidfd mechanism for Level Zero IPC exchange. It requires OS kernel SP4 or above as it requires Linux 5.6 kernel or above <br />
 &quot;sockets&quot; - Uses socket mechanism for Level Zero IPC exchange. It is usually slower than the other two mechanisms, but can be used for debugging as it is usually available on most systems
&quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot;: &quot;drmfd&quot;, &quot;pidfd&quot;, &quot;sockets&quot;
By-default: &quot;pidfd&quot; 
        

## CCL_ZE_DRM_BDF_SUPPORT


Use bdf support for mapping logical to physical devices. 
        


To obtain the physical device id based on the bdf, we need get and then parse the bdf values. Then using those values we can identify the particular device by referencing the appropriate fields in a pci configuration space for pci devices.to utilize bdf for the purpose of mapping logical devices to their corresponding physical devices.
&quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot; : &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;
By-default: &quot;1&quot; 
        

## CCL_REDUCE_SCATTER_FALLBACK_ALGO


Use the fallback algorithm for reduce_scatter. 
        


The fallback algorithm performs a full allreduce and then copies a subset of its output to the recv buffer. Currently, the fallback algorithm is used for scaleout whereas scaleup uses optimized algorithm.
&quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot; : &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;
By-default: &quot;0&quot; 
        

## CCL_ZE_AUTO_TUNE_PORTS


Automatically tune algorithm protocols based on port count.

&quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot; : &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;
By-default: &quot;1&quot; 
        

## CCL_ZE_PT2PT_READ


Enable switching of read and write protocols for pt2pt topo algorithm. 
        


Control pt2pt read/write protocols.<br />
 Read Protocol:<br />
 It means SEND side is exchanging the handle with RECV side. Then execute the copy operation on the RECV operation side, where the dst buf is the local buffer and the source buffer is the remote buffer.<br />
 Write Protocol:<br />
 it means RECV side is exchanging the handle with SEND side. Execute the copy operation on the SEND operation side, where the dst buf is the remote buffer and the source buffer is the local buffer. <br />
 &quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot; : &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot; <br />
 By-default: &quot;1&quot; 
        

## CCL_ZE_TYPE2_TUNE_PORTS


Tunable value for collectives to adjust copy engine indexes. 
        


use 2,4,6 copy engine indexes for host with 6 ports for allreduce, reduce and allgatherv &quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot;: &quot;on&quot; - always use write mode with calculated indexes &quot;off&quot; - always disabled &quot;detected&quot; - determined by the logic in detection &quot;undetected&quot; - the default value, used before the logic in detection
By-default: &quot;undetected&quot; 
        

## CCL_BARRIER_SYNC


Switch ccl::barrier() host-sync / host-async options. 
        


Historically ccl::barrier() was always synchronous. That does not match with oneCCL asynchronous concept. Same as other collectives, ccl::barrier() should be host-asynchronous if possible. As it would be too much to change in one moment, we start through experimental variable which introduces the option to make barrier host-asynchronous. Use CCL_BARRIER_SYNC=0 to achieve that.
By-default: &quot;1 (SYNC)&quot; 
        

## CCL_ENABLE_SYCL_KERNELS


Enable SYCL kernels. 
        


Setting this environment variable to 1 enables SYCL kernel-based implementation for allgatherv, allreduce, and reduce_scatter. Support includes all message sizes and some data types (int32, fp32, fp16, and bf16), sum operation, and single node. oneCCL falls back to other implementations when the support is not available with SYCL kernels, so the user can safely setup this environment variable.
&quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot; : &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;
By-default: &quot;0 (disabled)&quot; 
        

## CCL_SYCL_ALLGATHERV_TMP_BUF


Enable the use of persistent temporary buffer in allgatherv. 
        


Setting this environment variable to 1 enables the use of a persistent temporary buffer to perform the allgatherv operation. This implementation makes the collective fully asynchronous but adds some additional overhead due to the extra copy of the user buffer to a (persistent) temporary buffer.
&quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot; : &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;

Enable the use of persistent temporary buffer in reduce_scatter. 
        


Setting this environment variable to 1 enables the use of a persistent temporary buffer to perform the reduce_scatter operation. This implementation makes the collective fully asynchronous but adds some additional overhead due to the extra copy of the user buffer to a (persistent) temporary buffer.
&quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot; : &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;
