ReduceScatter
*************

**event CCL_API reduce_scatter (const void *send_buf, void *recv_buf, size_t recv_count, datatype dtype, reduction rtype, const communicator &comm, const stream &stream, const reduce_scatter_attr &attr=default_reduce_scatter_attr, const vector_class< event > &deps={})**
Reduce-scatter is a collective communication operation that performs the global reduction operation on values from all ranks of the communicator and scatters the result in blocks back to all ranks.

**Parameters**

* end_buf – the buffer with comm_size * count elements of dtype that stores local data to be reduced
* recv_buf – [out] the buffer to store result block containing recv_count elements of type dtype
* recv_count – the number of elements of type dtype in receive block
* dtype – the datatype of elements in send_buf and recv_buf
* rtype – the type of the reduction operation to be applied
* comm – the communicator for which the operation will be performed
* stream – a stream associated with the operation
* attr – optional attributes to customize operation
* deps – an optional vector of the events that the operation should depend on

**Returns**
ccl::event an object to track the progress of the operation
