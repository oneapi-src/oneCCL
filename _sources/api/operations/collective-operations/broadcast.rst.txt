Broadcast
*********

**event CCL_API broadcast (void *buf, size_t count, datatype dtype, int root, const communicator &comm, const stream &stream, const broadcast_attr &attr=default_broadcast_attr, const vector_class< event > &deps={})**

Broadcast is a collective communication operation that broadcasts data from one rank of communicator (denoted as root) to all other ranks.



**Parameters**

* buf – [in,out] the buffer with count elements of dtype serves as send buffer for root and as receive buffer for other ranks
* count – the number of elements of type dtype in buf
* dtype – the datatype of elements in buf
* root – the rank that broadcasts buf
* comm – the communicator for which the operation will be performed
* stream – a stream associated with the operation
* attr – optional attributes to customize operation
* deps – an optional vector of the events that the operation should depend on



**Returns**

ccl::event an object to track the progress of the operation
